### Sample of code

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b. Each element x in both arrays is integer and 0 ≤ x ≤ 25. And lengths of arrays can reach 5 000 000 elements.


If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from another.

```
function array_diff_very_fast(a, b) {
    let sB = new Set(b); // Create a new Set sB from the Array b                    
    return a.filter((el) => !sB.has(el)); // Return new Array with elements that are not in the Set sB  
}
```
